# Context7 MCP Usage Rule

- Use Context7 MCP for retrieving up-to-date library documentation
- Always resolve library IDs before fetching documentation
- Follow the two-step process:
  1. First call `mcp_context7_resolve-library-id` with the library name
  2. Then call `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` with the resolved ID

## When to Use
- When needing documentation for external libraries
- When answering questions about library usage
- When implementing code that uses external packages
